    <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>I’ve always had an eye for style and colors. My interest in fashion sparked in my early teens and gradually led me down the path of appreciating art in all its forms. That creativity evolved into <strong>Tiedyes.ke</strong>, a brand I used express myself by bringing simple, vibrant art to life on t-shirts — each one a little piece of my personality.</p>

        </a>
      </div>
      <p>I am currently purusing a degree in Software Engineering at the African Leadership University, a skill that will be useful in my content journey aside from my mission of incorporating tech in fighting climate change. For my internship at Untapped Global , I'm currently focusing on front-end web development to expand my digital skillset.</p>
      <p> I love content creation, especially when it's tied to my passions like fashion, fitness, and travel. </p>
      <p>My passion for content creation is mainly tied to my love for traveling  which helps me build my mindset and appreciate the gifts of life. I enjoy reviewing and critiquing restaurants and destinations, giving my honest take on places to visit.</p>
      <p>Although I don’t do content creation professionally, I create and share content out of passion. I’ve voluntarily created content for brands like <strong>La Roche</strong> to share my skincare journey, and for <strong>SmartGyms</strong> and <strong>Fitness Point Gym</strong> to document my fitness journey since 2023. I’ve also promoted events for brands such as <strong>Tufike Entertainment</strong>, known for lighting up Nairobi’s night scene.</p>
      <p>You can connect with me on Instagram: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/leila.abbie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@leila.abbie</a>, TikTok: <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abbie5085" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@abbie5085</a>, and LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leila-omol-112864302/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leila Omol</a>.</p>
      <p>   </p>
    <p>When I'm not creating content or working on school work, you can find me horse riding at Achis Ranch in Karen or The Jockey Club of Kenya. I also enjoy attending pop-up markets like the Organic Farmers Market, where I discover new products and enjoy good experiences.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: I absolutely love dogs, but can't own one because my sister is allergic. I’m saving to get a sausage dog once I move out — haha, stay tuned!</p>
